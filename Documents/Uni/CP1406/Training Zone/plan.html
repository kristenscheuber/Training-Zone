  <p>&lt;Kristen Scheuber &amp; JC459739&gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The Training Zone website is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers. 
    <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new website), so that any increase in sales should be attributed to the site At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and comapred to the previous 3 months. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our urrent audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at. </p>
